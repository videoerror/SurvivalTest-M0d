# Installation

Installation is fairly simple. First your going to need the latest release binary. So first head on down to the [releases](https://github.com/videoerror/SurvivalTest-M0d/releases) page and download either the DirectX(Recommended for Windows users) or OpenGL(Recommended for MacOS and Linux users) build. To install please place the "SurvivalTest_M0d-PR0T0TYPE-0_DirectX.exe" or "SurvivalTest_M0d-PR0T0TYPE-0_OpenGL.exe" file in your ClassicalSharp installation folder, deleting(Or moving it to a different location for when you'd like to switch back to the vanilla client) the old "ClassicalSharp.exe" and renaming "SurvivalTest_M0d-PR0T0TYPE-0_DirectX.exe" or "SurvivalTest_M0d-PR0T0TYPE-0_OpenGL.exe" to "ClassicalSharp.exe" so it is recognizable by the launcher. It is important to note that this mod was developed and made for ClassicalSharp releases __NOT__ development builds so some features may not work or are broken.
